        Our little family run shop is inspired by the magic of nature and the
        beauty of her elements; sea and mountains, plants and stones, sky and
        cosmos, and all of the transcendental experiences that come from our
        connection with her. We are further inspired by our favorite
        one-stop-shop for all things magical and inspiring: Crystal Dragon in
        Boulder, Colorado. We have brought home many a treasure from this
        wondrous little place and want to be of service to the world in a
        similar way.

        Objects in the physical world can bring joy and be tools to raise our
        frequency and connect us to a higher plane. We want to help uplift the
        collective by being a conduit of energy and inspiration, offering
        touchstones from earth and artist to humans on their journey.
